# Cisco Webex's Personal Meeting Room Prototype

This prototype was created Summer 2015 as a new proposal for Cisco Webex's premeeting experience. The prototype features an office like experience where the user enters an office with 3 walls. To the left, there is a wall displaying the meeting hosts public photo album, and to the right of the wall there is a white board that one can draw. The table and drinks are customizable and one can navigate the two walls by clicking and dragging.
